# Hello, I'm Jill !

I am Senior at Florida Polytechnic University, BS in Computer Science.

My interests lie in software development, website design, robotics programming, and AI applications in the medical field--so a little bit of everything!

This GitHub page documents my class assignments and personal projects that I've worked on during my coding journey.

Thank you for visiting !
